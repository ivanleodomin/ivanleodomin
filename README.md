- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name Ivan Dominguez and i'm backend developer and Welcome to my repository!

I'm a lover of science and technology; I love learning and teaching new things and challenging
myself in difficult contexts that test my logic and make me grow, both personally and professionally.
I like meeting people and interacting, working as a team, and having the initiative to propose new things.
I don't know everything, but my curious mind never stops learning! ðŸš€
