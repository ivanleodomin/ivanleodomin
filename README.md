- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is IvÃ¡n DomÃ­nguez and I'm a software developer, welcome to my repository!

I am a science and technology lover; I love learning and teaching new things, challenging myself in difficult contexts that test my logic and make me grow both personally and professionally.
I like meeting people and interacting, working in a team and having the initiative to come up with new things.
I don't know everything, but my curious mind never stops learning! ðŸš€
